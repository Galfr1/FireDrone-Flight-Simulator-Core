# FireDrone Flight Simulator Core
This software is our obstacle detection algorithm.
To download the software with GUI please download the exe file (for Windows only).

For using the algorithe only (without the GUI) we made the "core.py" file.
This file is very clear and have comments to explain the diffrent parts of the code.

To run the core.py file, install python 3 if you don't have it.
Then open the terminal and navigate to the folder that you saved the file using:

cd FOLDERPATH

Then run the file with:

python3 core.py

You can also edit the file and run it using your favorite code editor.
